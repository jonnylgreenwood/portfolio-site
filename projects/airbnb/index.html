  <h2 id="airbnb-analysis">Airbnb</h2>
  <p>A data consulting case study using CRISP-DM and iterative framework loops, incl snowflake and dbt.</p>

  <h3 id="overview">1. Overview</h3>

  <p>
    After formalising working processes into the CRIPSR methodology with dbt, I wanted to use this approach on
    cloud-based warehousing.

    For this, I chose to use SnowFlake due to it's popularity in the market and my interest in learning more about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project simulates how I’d work with a client exploring how to enter into the airbnb market.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus isn’t just on the data itself, but on the process: translating business strategy into measurable,
    data-driven outcomes through structured frameworks, transparent ETL, and iterative refinement.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Outcomes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Framework applied end-to-end with measurable business framing</li>
    <li>Scalable, reproducible ETL pipeline</li>
    <li>Reporting and modelling</li>
    <li>Iterative improvements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="process">2. Process</h3>

  <p>
    The process follows a cyclical framework, starting with the business defining its objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each iteration through the cycle deepens understanding and capability: as the business matures,
    the questions become more complex, and each loop may introduce new datasets, analytical methods,
    or performance metrics to support decision-making.

  <h3 id="tooling-overview">Tooling Overview: dbt & Snowflake</h3>

  <p>
    This project uses Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse and dbt for data transformation and modelling.

    Together, they enable:
  <ul>
    <li>A centralised, cloud-based single source of truth</li>
    <li>Clear separation between raw, cleansed, and curated data layers</li>
    <li>Reproducible, version-controlled transformations</li>
    <li>Transparent business logic embedded directly in SQL models</li>
    <li>Safe iteration as business questions evolve</li>
  </ul>
  The result is a structured analytics workflow that supports repeatable analysis, reliable reporting, and incremental
  decision-making.

  <h3 id="framework-loop-1">3. Framework Loop 1 - Core Business Case and Project Setup</h3>

  <h4 id="core-business-case">3.1 Core Business Case</h4>

  <p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong>
    Understand the volume of bookings per region, and the neighbourhoods with the most desirable properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    This first loop focuses on building the analytical foundation: understanding trip patterns,
    identifying high-demand zones, and developing a baseline for future optimisation.
  </p>

  <h4 id="etl-creation">3.2 ETL Creation</h4>

  <p>
    With the business objective defined, the first step was to design a reliable ETL
    (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process the Airbnb dataset efficiently and reproducibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase covers the Acquire &amp; Explore Data and Enrich &amp; Transform stages of the wider framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pipeline was built around three data layers (Raw, Cleansed, and Curated), each serving a distinct purpose,
    from storing unmodified source files to producing analysis-ready tables.
  </p>

    the methodology used, and a walk through on the below diagram.

  </p>

  <p>
    At every stage, data quality checks were used to maintain consistency and traceability.
  </p>

  <p>
    All code, documentation, and task tracking were managed through GitHub,
    ensuring version control and transparency as the project evolved.
