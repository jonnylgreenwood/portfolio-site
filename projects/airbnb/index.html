    <p>CRISP-DM–driven analytics using Snowflake & dbt.</p>
  </i>

  <h3 id="overview">1. Overview</h3>

  <p>
    This project demonstrates how I approach data consulting engagements using a structured, iterative framework based
    on CRISP-DM, implemented through dbt and Snowflake.</p>
  <p>

    The case study simulates working with a client exploring entry into the Airbnb rental market. Rather than focusing
    solely on outputs, the emphasis is on process: translating business strategy into measurable, data-driven outcomes
    through clear frameworks, transparent ETL, and repeatable analytical loops.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Outcomes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end application of a business-led analytical framework</li>
    <li>Scalable, reproducible ETL pipeline</li>
    <li>Analytics-ready data models to support reporting and decision-making</li>
    <li>Iterative refinement as business questions evolve</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="process">2. Process</h3>

  <p>
    The project follows a cyclical analytics framework, beginning with business objectives and looping through
    progressively deeper levels of insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each iteration expands capability: as the business matures, questions become more granular, new datasets are
    introduced, and metrics evolve to support more sophisticated decisions.

  <h3 id="tooling-overview">Tooling Overview: dbt & Snowflake</h3>

  <p>
    This project uses Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse and dbt for data transformation and modelling.

    Together, they enable:
  <ul>
    <li>A centralised, cloud-based single source of truth</li>
    <li>Clear separation between raw, cleansed, and curated data layers</li>
    <li>Reproducible, version-controlled transformations</li>
    <li>Transparent business logic embedded directly in SQL models</li>
    <li>Safe iteration as business questions evolve</li>
  </ul>
  The result is a structured analytics workflow that supports repeatable analysis, reliable reporting, and incremental
  decision-making.

    <h3 id="framework-loop-1">3. Framework Loop 1 - Core Business Case and Project Setup</h3>
  </a>

  <h4 id="core-business-case">3.1 Core Business Case</h4>

  <p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong>
    Enable a prospective Airbnb investor to quickly assess revenue potential for a property purchase using market-level
    data and simple assumptions.

    This loop focuses on speed, clarity, and risk reduction, not precision.
  </p>

  <h4 id="etl-creation">3.2 ETL Creation</h4>

  <p>
    With the business objective defined, the first step was to design a reliable ETL
    (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process the Airbnb dataset efficiently and reproducibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase covers the Acquire &amp; Explore Data and Enrich &amp; Transform stages of the wider framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pipeline was built around three data layers (Raw, Cleansed, and Curated), each serving a distinct purpose,
    from storing unmodified source files to producing analysis-ready tables.
  </p>
  <p>

    the methodology used, and a walk through on the below diagram.

  </p>

  <p>
    At every stage, data quality checks were used to maintain consistency and traceability.
  </p>

  <p>
    All code, documentation, and task tracking were managed through GitHub,
    ensuring version control and transparency as the project evolved.
