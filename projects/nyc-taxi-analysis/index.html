  <h2 id="nyc-taxi-fleet-analysis">NYC Taxi Fleet Analysis</h2>
  <p>A data consulting case study using CRISP-DM and iterative framework loops.</p>

  <h3 id="overview">1. Overview</h3>

  <p>
    When I discovered the NYC Taxi dataset, I saw it as the perfect playground to demonstrate
    how a Data Consultant applies the CRISP-DM framework in practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project simulates how I’d work with a client exploring how to enter and compete in the NYC taxi market,
    from defining business objectives to building analytical solutions that guide real-world decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus isn’t just on the data itself, but on the process: translating business strategy into measurable,
    data-driven outcomes through structured frameworks, transparent ETL, and iterative refinement.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Outcomes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Framework applied end-to-end with measurable business framing</li>
    <li>Scalable, reproducible ETL pipeline</li>
    <li>Reporting and modelling</li>
    <li>Iterative improvements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="process">2. Process</h3>

  <p>
    The process follows a cyclical framework, starting with the business defining its objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each iteration through the cycle deepens understanding and capability: as the business matures,
    the questions become more complex, and each loop may introduce new datasets, analytical methods,
    or performance metrics to support decision-making.

  <h3 id="framework-loop-1">3. Framework Loop 1 - Core Business Case and Project Setup</h3>

  <h4 id="core-business-case">3.1 Core Business Case</h4>

  <p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong>
    The business operates a fleet of 1,000 vehicles, each working 8 hours per day, 5 days per week.
    The goal is to maximise total revenue by optimising fleet deployment, ensuring vehicles are in
    the right place, at the right time, to capture demand efficiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    This first loop focuses on building the analytical foundation: understanding trip patterns,
    identifying high-demand zones, and developing a baseline for future optimisation.
  </p>

  <h4 id="etl-creation">3.2 ETL Creation</h4>

  <p>
    With the business objective defined, the first step was to design a reliable ETL
    (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process the NYC Taxi dataset efficiently and reproducibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase covers the Acquire &amp; Explore Data and Enrich &amp; Transform stages of the wider framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pipeline was built around three data layers (Raw, Cleansed, and Curated), each serving a distinct purpose,
    from storing unmodified source files to producing analysis-ready tables.
  </p>

    the methodology used, and a walk through on the below diagram.

  <p>
    At every stage, data quality checks were used to maintain consistency and traceability.
  </p>

  <p>
    All code, documentation, and task tracking were managed through GitHub,
    ensuring version control and transparency as the project evolved.
